 * Hey!

 * This excercise is about functions and Date in JavaScript.
 * Please find the doc which you have to study before jump in:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
 * yeah.. you should interpret a lot if technical JS docs in the future and this is the very first time I ask you for do it alone and YES, I am aware that it is not easy for the first time... But it is a required skill! Just take an attempt and we will see.. No pressure :)
 * I will help you, take it easy :)
 * Let's see your task

// this function has to calculate your age based on the birth date(year).. so easy!
const calculateMyAge = (birthYear) => {
  // WTF??? yeah it is the ES6 syntax of function definition called arrow function (why arrow?? heeeeey.. I guess..mmmm... Just try a shoot XD)
  // same as:
  // function calculateMyAge(birthYear)
  // just ignore the export thing, I will explain it later

  // You will store the return value in this variable
  let myAge

  // You will store the current year in this variable (see the doc above.. how we can get the current year using Date constructor.. check the methods on the left side! Their names are very self-explanatory)
  let currentYear

  myAge = 'placeholder text, please replace it with your code!'

  return myAge
}

module.exports = {
  calculateMyAge
}
